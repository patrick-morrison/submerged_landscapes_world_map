# Submerged landscapes map

This map shops submerged lands all over the world. It highlights -130m -  lowest sea level during the last ice age (22ka), -30m - how deep most scientific divers can work to, and 0m - present day land.
The image was generated by styling all the GEBCO world imagery in QGIS. Similar steps can be found [here](https://padmorrison.com/posts/2021-04-03-mapping-paleoshorelines-in-qgis/). 

They were then processed into a TMS layer using gdal2tiles, and the pngs optimised:
```
gdal2tiles.py --zoom=0-7 submerged_world_map_compressed.tif output_folder
find . -type f -iname "*.png" -exec optipng -nb -nc {} \;
```

Some changes were made to the leaflet file as well, to add styling and a legend.
